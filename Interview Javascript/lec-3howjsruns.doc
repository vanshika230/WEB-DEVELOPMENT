->code runs in execution context
->execution context - wrapper 
    1. global object - created when fnx is created
    2. this variable - created at runtime
->the code which is not a part of a function is called global code , or that piece of code is called global area
->wrapper made for global code is Global Execution context
->Global Execution context:-
     global - Node= global object Browser = window
     this   - Node={}             Browser = window 
->creation phase gives us global,this,memory allocation
->memory allocation -> undefined called hoisting
->functions can be called before declaration as well
